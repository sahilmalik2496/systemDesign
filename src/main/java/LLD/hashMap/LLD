Internal Working of HashMap in Java
Javaâ€™s HashMap is part of the java.util package and is based on hashing to store key-value pairs. It allows constant-time complexity (O(1)) for operations like get() and put() in the average case.

1. Key Components of HashMap
(a) Hash Table Structure
Internally, a HashMap consists of:

An array of nodes (also called buckets).
Each node is an instance of an Entry (Node<K, V>), which stores:
key
value
hash (computed using the key)
next (reference to the next node in case of collisions)
(b) Node Structure
Each entry in the HashMap is represented as:

java
Copy
Edit
static class Node<K, V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K, V> next; // For handling collisions (linked list)

    Node(int hash, K key, V value, Node<K, V> next) {
        this.hash = hash;
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
        this.next = next;
    }
}
2. Working of HashMap Operations
(a) Storing (put operation)
java
Copy
Edit
map.put("Sahil", 101);
Steps:
Hashing the Key
hashCode() method is called on "Sahil" (e.g., returns 325478).
hash() function processes it to find the index in the table:
java
Copy
Edit
int index = (hashCode % capacity)
If capacity = 16, then:
java
Copy
Edit
index = 325478 % 16 = 14
Inserting into the Bucket
If the bucket is empty, create a new node at index 14.
If collision occurs (another entry already exists at index 14):
Chaining: Add the new node to the linked list.
(b) Retrieving (get operation)
java
Copy
Edit
map.get("Sahil");
Steps:
Compute the hash code and determine the index.
Go to the bucket at that index.
If multiple elements (collision handling), iterate through the linked list to find the matching key.
Return the corresponding value.
(c) Collision Handling
When multiple keys hash to the same index, HashMap uses chaining (Linked List) and TreeMap (after a threshold).

Before Java 8: Uses a Linked List.
Since Java 8: If more than 8 nodes exist in a bucket, the list converts into a Red-Black Tree to improve lookup time from O(n) to O(log n).
(d) Rehashing & Resizing
Default capacity = 16, load factor = 0.75.
When size exceeds 75% of capacity, a rehashing occurs:
The table doubles in size.
All existing entries are rehashed and redistributed.
3. Example Code & Debugging
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.*;

public class HashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Inserting values
        map.put("Alice", 100);
        map.put("Bob", 200);
        map.put("Charlie", 300);

        // Fetching values
        System.out.println("Alice's value: " + map.get("Alice"));
        System.out.println("Bob's value: " + map.get("Bob"));

        // Collision Test (Same index)
        map.put("David", 400); // Might cause a collision

        System.out.println("Final HashMap: " + map);
    }
}
4. Time Complexity Analysis
Operation	Average Case	Worst Case
put()	O(1)	O(n) (if all keys collide)
get()	O(1)	O(n) (if all keys collide)
remove()	O(1)	O(n)
ðŸš€ Optimized HashMap avoids collisions and ensures fast lookups using hash functions and tree restructuring! ðŸš€

Yes! Below is a simplified implementation of HashMap in Java, supporting put(), get(), and remove(). It uses chaining (Linked List) for collision handling and resizes dynamically when the load factor exceeds 0.75.
