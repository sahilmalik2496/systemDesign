1. Introduction to Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming. It is widely used for messaging, log aggregation, event sourcing, and real-time analytics.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Scalable: Handles millions of messages per second
âœ… Fault-tolerant: Replicates data across multiple brokers
âœ… High throughput & low latency: Suitable for real-time applications
âœ… Decouples microservices: Acts as a buffer between producers & consumers

2. Kafka Architecture
Kafka follows a publish-subscribe model and consists of the following components:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Producer
Applications that send (produce) messages to Kafka topics.
Pushes data to Kafka asynchronously.
ðŸ”¹ 2. Topics & Partitions
Topic: A category in Kafka where messages are published.
Partition: Each topic is split into multiple partitions for parallel processing.
Replication: Partitions are replicated across brokers for fault tolerance.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Brokers
A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers (Kafka servers).
Each broker stores partitions of different topics.
A leader broker manages reads/writes, while others act as followers.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Consumers & Consumer Groups
Consumers subscribe to topics and process messages.
A Consumer Group ensures that each message is processed only once by any one consumer.
ðŸ”¹ 5. Zookeeper
Manages Kafka brokers, leader election, and topic metadata.
Ensures fault tolerance and high availability.

Kafka vs Other Messaging Systems
Feature	Kafka	RabbitMQ	ActiveMQ
Throughput	âœ… High	Medium	Medium
Scalability	âœ… Horizontally Scalable	Limited	Limited
Ordering	âœ… Yes (within partition)	No	No
Storage	âœ… Durable	No	No
Use Case	Streaming & Event Processing	Request-Response	Enterprise Messaging

Key Components in Kafka LLD
Kafka follows a Producer-Consumer Model, which consists of the following key components:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Broker
A Kafka broker is a node (server) that stores topics and partitions. It handles read/write requests and ensures high availability.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Producer
A producer sends messages to a Kafka topic. It chooses a partition for the message and pushes it to the broker.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Consumer
A consumer subscribes to a topic and processes messages. It maintains an offset to keep track of read messages.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Topic & Partition
A topic is a logical grouping of messages. Each topic is divided into partitions for parallelism.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Zookeeper (Cluster Management)
Zookeeper is used for leader election, broker metadata, and partition assignment.
