The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid multiple if-else or switch statements for choosing behavior.

🔧 When to Use Strategy Pattern
You have multiple algorithms for a specific task.

The algorithm needs to be selected at runtime.

You want to reduce complex conditional logic.

You want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).

🧱 Key Components
Strategy (Interface) – Common interface for all supported algorithms.

Concrete Strategies – Implementations of the Strategy interface.

Context – Uses a Strategy object and is configured with a Concrete Strategy.

✅ Advantages
Cleaner code with better separation of concerns.

Open for extension: New algorithms can be added without changing existing code.

Removes tight coupling between context and algorithm.

❌ Disadvantages
Increases the number of classes.

Client must be aware of different strategies to choose appropriately.

🔁 Real-world Use Cases
Sorting with different comparators.

Payment gateways.

Compression algorithms (ZIP, RAR, etc.).

Authentication strategies (OAuth, SAML, JWT, etc.).
