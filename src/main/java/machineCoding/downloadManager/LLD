Low-Level Design of a Download Manager
A download manager should efficiently handle multiple downloads, manage pause/resume operations, and provide a way to track progress. Below is the detailed low-level design.

Key Features
Concurrent Downloads: Support multiple simultaneous downloads.
Pause/Resume: Allow downloads to be paused and resumed.
Progress Tracking: Provide progress updates for each download.
Error Handling: Handle retries for failed downloads.
Extensibility: Easily add features like scheduling or limiting download speed.

Core Components
1. DownloadManager
The main class that orchestrates download tasks.

Responsibilities:

Manage a pool of threads for concurrent downloads.
Start, pause, resume, or cancel downloads.
Track progress of all downloads.
2. DownloadTask
Represents an individual download.

Responsibilities:

Download data from a given URL to a destination file.
Manage download states (e.g., RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED).
Support pause, resume, and cancel operations.
3. HttpDownloader
Handles HTTP-specific downloading, including range requests for resuming.

4. FileDownloader
Manages writing downloaded data to a file.

5. DownloadState (Enum)
Defines the states a download can be in:

QUEUED
RUNNING
PAUSED
COMPLETED
CANCELED


Advantages of the Design
Scalability: The ThreadPoolExecutor allows controlled concurrency.
Extensibility: Adding new features like download speed throttling or scheduled downloads is straightforward.
Error Handling: Retry logic can be implemented in the DownloadTask class.
Separation of Concerns: Each class has a single responsibility, improving code maintainability.
