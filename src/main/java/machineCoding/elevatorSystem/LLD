Low-Level Design (LLD) for an Elevator System
An Elevator System is responsible for efficiently transporting passengers or goods between floors in a building. It should handle multiple requests, prioritize calls, and manage the state of the elevator.

Core Functionalities
Floor Request Handling:
Process requests from inside the elevator (button panel).
Process requests from outside the elevator (up/down buttons).
Movement Control:
Move up or down based on requests.
Stop at requested floors.
Door Operations:
Open/close doors when required.
Display and Notifications:
Show current floor.
Announce floor arrival.
Fault Handling:
Handle emergency stops.
Go into maintenance mode if needed.

State Diagram for the Elevator
The elevator has several states:

Idle: Waiting for a request.
Moving: Traveling between floors.
Stopping: Pausing at a requested floor.
Opening Doors: Doors are opening.
Closing Doors: Doors are closing.

Extensibility Features

Allow priority requests for VIP users.
Advanced Scheduling:
Implement intelligent scheduling to optimize elevator usage.
Maintenance Mode:
Disable elevators during maintenance.
Energy Saving:
Optimize idle elevators to stay on middle floors to reduce waiting time.
Display Enhancements:
Add floor arrival notifications and voice announcements.
