Explanation
Class Design:

User class encapsulates user details and connections.
LinkedInService acts as the core business logic layer, managing users and connections.
Extensibility:

The design can easily incorporate features like recommendations by adding algorithms for "mutual connections" or "connection suggestions."
Adding new features like messages or posts involves introducing new entities (e.g., Message or Post).
Scalability:

Data can be sharded by user_id for distributed storage.
Redis can be used for caching frequent operations (e.g., fetching connections).
HLD Representation
Users Service: Handles profile creation, updates, and retrievals.
Connections Service: Manages user connections and relationships.
Feed Service: Handles posts and their interactions (likes, comments).
Messaging Service: Manages real-time communication.
Search Service: Supports searching users, jobs, and posts.
Notifications Service: Sends real-time updates to users.
HLD Diagram:

Use microservices for the above modules.
API Gateway for routing user requests.
Databases like PostgreSQL for transactional data and Elasticsearch for fast search queries.
Pub/Sub systems like Kafka for notifications.
