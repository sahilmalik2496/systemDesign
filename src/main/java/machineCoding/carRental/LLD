addCar(car): Add a car to the fleet.
findAvailableCars(startDate, endDate): Find cars available during the rental period.
rentCar(customerID, carID, startDate, endDate): Rent a car to the customer.
returnCar(rentalID): Return the rented car and update status.
Invoice
Attributes: rentalID, totalAmount, paymentStatus (paid, pending) Methods:

2. Use Case Example
A customer logs in to the car rental system.
The system displays a list of available cars (based on date).
The customer selects a car and rents it.
The system calculates the total rental amount.
After the rental period, the customer returns the car and pays for the rental.
3. Database Schema
Cars Table: carID, make, model, year, rentalPricePerDay, status
Customers Table: customerID, name, email, phoneNumber, licenseNumber
Rentals Table: rentalID, customerID, carID, startDate, endDate, totalAmount
Invoices Table: invoiceID, rentalID, totalAmount, paymentStatus
