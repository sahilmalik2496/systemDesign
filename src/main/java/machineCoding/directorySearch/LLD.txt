Design of Requirements (DoR): Directory Filtering Library
Objective
To design and implement a library that allows users to read files from a directory and perform operations such as filtering files by type (e.g., .txt, .jpg) and size constraints (e.g., files larger than 1MB).

Core Features
Directory Reading

Traverse a specified directory and list all files.
Support recursive reading of subdirectories.
Filtering Operations

Filter files by file type (extension-based filtering).
Filter files by size constraints (e.g., minimum size, maximum size).
Support combining multiple filters using logical operations (e.g., AND, OR).
Output and Interaction

Return filtered results as a list of files with their metadata (e.g., name, size, path).
Provide options to export filtered results (e.g., print to console or save to a file).
Extensibility

Allow users to define custom filters (e.g., by creation date, modification date).
Provide a mechanism for combining custom filters with existing ones.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance

Efficiently handle large directories with thousands of files.
Optimize for file system I/O operations to minimize latency.
Modularity

Ensure that the library has a modular design, enabling easy addition of new filters or output formats.
Error Handling

Gracefully handle edge cases, such as:
Non-existent or inaccessible directories.
Files without extensions.
Empty directories.
Provide meaningful error messages to users.
Platform Compatibility

Support common operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Use standard Java APIs for file system access.
Testability

Provide unit tests and integration tests to ensure library functionality.
Include mock directories and files for testing.
High-Level Architecture
Core Components

FileReader
Reads a directory and retrieves file metadata (e.g., name, size, type, path).
Filter
Interface for defining filtering criteria. Example implementations:
TypeFilter: Filters by file extension.
SizeFilter: Filters by file size.
CompositeFilter
Combines multiple filters using logical operations (AND, OR).
ResultHandler
Handles filtered results (e.g., display or save results).
API Design

Public APIs should provide:
Initialization of the library with the target directory.
Adding filters for type and size constraints.
Executing the filter operation.
Retrieving or exporting results.

Example Usage
Step 1: Initialize the Library
The user initializes the library with a directory path.

Step 2: Add Filters
The user can add filters such as:

Filter files by extension (.txt, .jpg).
Filter files larger than 1MB.
Step 3: Execute
The library reads the directory, applies the filters, and returns the filtered files.
