Approach
API 1: Track User Visits

Maintain a HashMap to store user IDs and their visit counts.
Increment the count for a user every time they visit.
API 2: Get the First User to Visit Only Once

Use a LinkedHashMap to maintain the insertion order and track visit counts.
Return the first user from the map where the count is 1.
Follow-up: Get the First N Users Who Visited Only Once

Iterate through the LinkedHashMap and collect the first N users with a visit count of 1.


Explanation
Data Structure Choice:

LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order while providing O(1) operations for get and put.
API 1: trackVisit:

Increments the count of visits for a given user.
If the user is new, they are added with a count of 1.
API 2: getFirstUniqueUser:

Iterates through the map and returns the first user with a count of 1.
Follow-up API: getFirstNUniqueUsers:

Iterates through the map and collects the first N users with a count of 1.
Time Complexity
Tracking Visits (trackVisit):

O(1) for insertion/updating in the LinkedHashMap.
Get First Unique User (getFirstUniqueUser):

O(N), where N is the number of users in the LinkedHashMap.
Get First N Unique Users (getFirstNUniqueUsers):

O(N) for iterating over the LinkedHashMap.
Scalability
If the number of users is large, consider sharding the LinkedHashMap across multiple servers.
Use caching mechanisms like Redis if needed for distributed systems.
For frequent queries, maintain a separate list of unique users and update it dynamically as visits are tracked.
This design ensures efficient tracking and retrieval of unique users, even for large datasets.
