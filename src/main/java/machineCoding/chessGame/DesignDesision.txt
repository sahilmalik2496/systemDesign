Design Decisions
Core Components:

ChessGame: Manages the flow of the game, tracks players, and determines the current player.
ChessBoard: Represents the 8x8 grid and manages the state of all pieces.
Player: Represents a player and tracks their status (e.g., check, checkmate).
Piece: Abstract class for common behaviors of all chess pieces. Derived classes (Pawn, Rook, etc.) implement specific movement rules.
Separation of Concerns:

Chessboard handles piece placement and movement validation.
Each piece class determines valid moves based on its movement logic.
The game orchestrates interactions between players and the board.
Extensibility:

Adding new pieces (e.g., a custom piece) is straightforward by extending the Piece class.
Rules and validation logic can evolve independently for each piece.
Encapsulation:

Movement and validation rules are encapsulated in the respective classes, ensuring modularity.
