Objective
Design a Unix File Search API that allows searching files in a directory based on various criteria such as extension, name, and size. The design should be extensible to support new constraints in the future.

Key Considerations
Extensibility:

Easily add new search criteria without modifying existing code.
Follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) from SOLID design principles.
Reusability:

Keep logic modular to reuse existing filters.
Performance:

Handle large directories efficiently by avoiding unnecessary checks.
Usability:

Provide a clean API for end-users.
Design
Core Components:

FileSearchEngine: The main class for searching files.
FileSearchFilter: An interface that defines the filtering behavior.
Concrete Filters: Implementations of FileSearchFilter for specific criteria like extension, name, size, etc.
Extensibility:

New filters can be added by creating a new class implementing the FileSearchFilter interface.
Composite Pattern:

Use the Composite Pattern to combine multiple filters.
