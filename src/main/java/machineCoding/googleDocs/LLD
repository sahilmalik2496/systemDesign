Low-Level Design for Real-Time Collaborative Document Editing Platform
The design focuses on the key components and interactions necessary to implement a system like Google Docs, emphasizing collaboration, real-time updates, and consistency.

Core Features
Real-time Collaboration:
Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
Changes are reflected in real time across all connected clients.
Conflict Resolution:
Handle concurrent edits using Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).
Document Storage:
Persist documents on the server for reliability.
Maintain version history for rollback and tracking changes.
Access Control:
Support roles like viewer, editor, or owner.
Scalability:
Handle a large number of users and documents.
Offline Support:
Allow users to edit documents offline and sync changes when reconnected.

Core Components
1. Document:
Represents the document being edited.
Tracks the content and version.
Applies edits sequentially to maintain consistency.
2. Edit:
Represents a change made by a user.
Contains details like the operation (insert/delete), position, and text.
3. UserSession:
Represents an active user editing a document.
Handles sending edits to the server and receiving updates.
4. Server:
Manages all documents and user sessions.
Handles edits, resolves conflicts, and broadcasts updates.
Flow of Operations
User Edit Flow:

A user makes an edit in the document.
The UserSession sends the edit to the server.
Server Handling:

The server receives the edit.
It applies the edit to the document (after resolving conflicts, if any).
Broadcasts the update to all other active users.
Receiving Updates:

Other users receive the update via their UserSession.
Their local view of the document is updated.



Scalability and Extensions
Conflict Resolution:

Use Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT to handle concurrent edits.
Persistence:

Use a database to persist documents and their version history.
Sharding:

Distribute documents across multiple servers for scalability.
Event Queues:

Use message queues (e.g., Kafka) to process and broadcast updates efficiently.
Security:

Implement authentication and authorization for access control.
Offline Support:

Maintain a local copy of edits and sync them when the user comes online.
This design ensures real-time collaboration, consistency, and scalability while allowing room for future extensions.
