Designing an ATM System
An ATM system involves various components like account management, withdrawal, deposit, balance checking, authentication, and transaction management. Here's a high-level object-oriented design and code implementation for an ATM system.

Key Components/Entities:
Account: Holds account details like balance and account type.
ATM: Represents the ATM machine which processes transactions.
User: Represents a customer who interacts with the ATM.
Transaction: Represents each transaction (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
Bank: Manages accounts and transactions.
Card: Represents a user’s ATM card that is used for authentication.
PIN: A user’s PIN for authentication.
High-Level Design:
Account Management: Handles user account information, balance, and transaction history.
Transaction Management: Responsible for withdrawal, deposit, and transfer functionality.
Authentication: Ensures security via card and PIN validation.
ATM Interface: User interface for withdrawing, depositing, checking balance, and printing receipts.


Key Design Decisions:
Account Management: Account class handles deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
ATM System: The ATM class is the main controller for all operations, such as deposits, withdrawals, and account balance retrieval.
Authentication: Uses a simple card and PIN system for authentication. This can be extended to support multi-factor authentication or integrate with a backend for more secure systems.
Transaction Handling: Each transaction is recorded and can be extended for features like transaction history, receipts, or fraud detection.
Separation of Concerns: Each class focuses on its specific responsibility, such as Account for account-related actions and ATM for processing transactions.
Possible Extensions:
Implementing transaction history for each account.
Supporting multiple accounts per user.
Integrating with a banking API for actual banking operations.
Adding security measures like encryption for sensitive data such as PINs.
