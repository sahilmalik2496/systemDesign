Design of Requirements (DoR): Job Scheduler
Objective
The goal is to design and implement a Job Scheduler that can manage and execute jobs based on specific triggers like delays, periodic schedules, or custom conditions.

Core Features
Job Management

Add, remove, or update jobs.
Support different job types (e.g., one-time, recurring).
Assign priorities to jobs.
Scheduling Mechanisms

Support time-based triggers:
Delay: Run a job after a specified delay.
Periodic: Run a job repeatedly at a fixed interval.
Support cron-like scheduling (optional for advanced requirements).
Execution

Execute jobs using worker threads.
Ensure thread safety and proper concurrency handling.
Monitoring

Track job status (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed).
Provide logs for executed jobs.
Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability

Handle a large number of jobs efficiently.
Support concurrent execution of multiple jobs.
Extensibility

Allow users to define custom job types.
Add support for new triggers in the future.
Reliability

Handle job failures gracefully.
Retry failed jobs based on configurable policies.
Performance

Minimize latency in job execution.
Optimize resource utilization with thread pooling.
Testability

Provide unit tests for core functionality.
Mock job execution for testing.
